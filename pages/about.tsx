        <p className={answerStyle}>
          The Exeter Course Map is meant to help PEA students choose their
          courses. While the Course Catalog is good as a reference book,
          it&rsquo;s very long and dense, so many students don&rsquo;t fully
          read it. Tree-styled graphs are optimal for quickly representing the
          prerequisite relationships between different courses.
        </p>
        <p className={questionStyle}>
          How can I see all the classes I can take in a subject?
        </p>
        <p className={answerStyle}>
          Different subjects/groups of subjects are displayed in submaps, which
          you can find in the &quot;Maps&quot; page. These submaps list all the
          courses in a subject and their prereqs/coreqs.
        </p>
        <p className={questionStyle}>How do I navigate the maps?</p>
        <p className={answerStyle}>
          You can pan around the map by scrolling on trackpad or clicking and
          dragging, and you can zoom in/out by pinching on trackpad or scrolling
          with your scroll wheel.

        <p className={questionStyle}>
          How do I keep the course information popup on screen?
        </p>
        <p className={answerStyle}>
          Right-click (two-finger click with trackpads) on a course to pin its
          information popup on the screen. Left-click anywhere else on the map
          to unpin this popup.

          What features will be added in the future?
        </p>
        <p className={answerStyle}>
          We first plan on implementing a database where you can input the
          classes you&rsquo;ve completed. Then we can show you your progress
          towards diploma requirements and grey out the courses you can&rsquo;t
          take. We also want to implement a &quot;friend&quot; system where you
          can see the courses your friends are planning to take.

        <p className={questionStyle}>Who made this website?</p>
        <p className={answerStyle}>
          The Exeter Course Map was designed and built by Michael Chen
          &rsquo;23, Byran Huang &rsquo;25, Nathan Khuu &rsquo;23, and Eric Li
          &rsquo;25 from the Exeter Computing Club Project Group. We also want
          to thank Avaninder Bhaghayath &rsquo;26 for helping us fix our
          database.
