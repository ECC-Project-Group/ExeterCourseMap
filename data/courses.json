    "desc": "Anthropologists study humans as both biological and cultural creatures. This scholarly orientation raises many fascinating questions. To what degree does culture shape our actions and ideas? Are we primarily products of biological nature or cultural nurture? Can cultural norms make rational people act irrationally? Are there universal human rights or do cultures dictate what we think is ethical? These debates are critical for understanding human interaction and have significant application in fields ranging from law to medicine. Although discussions of these topics many times turn toward scientific explanations, this course provides students an opportunity to explore other scholarly orientations; namely, the nurture side of the debate. Using various anthropological approaches, students will explore patterns of behavior, both consciously articulated and unconsciously practiced, that enriches and profoundly shapes our lives. Among the topics considered are: \"the mind\" and epistemology; discipline, law, and rules; human bodies and communication; social taboos; ritual patterns of meaning; notions of cleanliness and defilement; festivals; and mythology. These elements of cultural life will be explored in social settings spanning the globe, but also within our own community at Phillips Exeter Academy. To gain a greater appreciation of these topics, students will be exposed to classic readings in anthropology, developing a sense of the field as it emerged out of the late 19th-century. Much of the course attempts to contextualize 20th-century anthropological methods against the foil of postmodern critiques.",

The concept of entropy will be a unifying theme throughout the course, and, given its central role, time will be devoted to developing a rigorous mathematical model of entropy through the use of probability and multi-variable calculus. The more traditional topics of thermodynamics will be presented relatively quickly. The first and second laws of thermodynamics will be explored; the fundamental equations of thermodynamics, as differential equations, will be used to define the properties of temperature, pressure and chemical potential; and the concept of free energy (and its importance in describing equilibrium) will be developed. The Boltzmann distribution law (and the partition function) will be derived and then used, along with simple physical models, to compute thermodynamic and physical properties of systems at equilibrium. Following a brief look at quantum theory and statistical mechanics, the equilibrium constant expression will be derived (by employing the partition function) and values for gas-phase chemical equilibrium constants will be computed and compared to empirical values. Finally, lattice models will be used to explore properties of liquids, liquid/vapor equilibrium and solutions.

Our texts will include works by Sophocles, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, August Wilson, Dominique Morisseau and Annie Baker. The goal of the course is to examine the effect of social and historical contexts on the creation and reception of the genre by studying various texts and schools, including realism and verse drama. We will also discuss plays that address issues of power and identity by examining works written by diverse playwrights. By examining form and content, students will be able to discuss dramatic structure, use of dialogue, setting and character. Students will write 10-minute plays and short analytical papers.",

What many do not know, however, is that her then-estranged husband and editor, poet Ted Hughes, significantly altered this manuscript (which she had intended to be titled Ariel and Other Poems) before publishing it in 1965 - by including poems that were meant to be part of a separate manuscript and taking out poems, some of which were condemning to him. He revealed this 16 years after the fact, and during that time, the collection that he had refashioned became iconic. Through a close examination of the two versions of Ariel, and through the editing and writing of their own poem sequences, students will be asked to consider the narrative and thematic arc of a collection, the creative process, and the influence and complexities of editorship.",

The primary activity will be to produce a Book of Voices: reflections by alums, students and community members on their experiences as girls, women, queer and trans students/adults at PEA. The project will consider the impact of coeducation on personal experiences as well as academic disciplines and administrative departments. Themes will include access, belonging, nostalgia, unconscious bias, language (including the word \"coeducation\"), safe spaces, empowerment, equality and passing. Working from the assumption that lived experience is knowledge, students will craft handmade books of personal stories for inclusion in the Academy archives to highlight and reinscribe diverse, sometimes untold, histories into institutional memory. Students will undertake a critical exploration of feminist, gender, queer and intersectional theories to frame this radical gesture of inclusion in order to examine how these theories illuminate issues in gender and education. Students will learn bookbinding techniques, consider how books (and related objects) represent, disseminate, exclude and validate knowledge, and explore how a book literally and metaphorically can \"take up space\" in institutional history. Key resources include: Ramia Maz\u00e9's Bookmaking as a Critical Feminist Practice; Marika Cifor and Stacy Wood's Critical Feminism in the Archives; Kimberle Crenshaw's \"On Intersectionality\"; Nancy Weiss Malkiel's \"Keep the Damned Women Out\": The Struggle for Coeducation; literature by Julia Alvarez, Adrienne Rich, Elizabeth Alexander, Kim McLarin '82, Roxane Gay '90 and Stephanie Han; and the bookmaking practices of Clarissa Sligh and Julie Chen.

The second part of the course is devoted to the study of Earth’s climate system and the current global climate crisis. Students will study Earth’s energy budget and the effects of various natural and anthropogenic factors that control the climate, such as solar radiation, greenhouse gases, aerosols, ocean circulation, Milankovitch cycles, El Niño events and volcanic eruptions.

The extent to which social systems are open or closed determine a person's social mobility or how easily they can acquire or lose resources.

Beginning in Babylon, the course orients students to an understanding of these subjects as practiced in the premodern world. With this conceptual foundation, students gain an understanding of the categorization of witchcraft and other questionable or deviant practices during the Middle Ages through the Age of Enlightenment. As these forms of Western thinking spread throughout the globe on the waves of imperialism, Europeans encountered practices of indigenous cultures that they classified as taboo or dangerous. Buttressed by a cosmic view of good and evil, Westerners sought to persecute such behaviors, attributing them as manifestations of the devil's minions. This course exposes students to the theoretical debates and historical contexts where violent exchanges often took place in regions such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. Among the topics considered are the relationship of institutional power to societal beliefs in the supernatural; social constructions of purity, taboo and danger; gender roles and behavioral norms; categories of magic; curative practices; and the categorization of \"madness\" or mental disorders.

Based on a wide range of new scholarship that examines slavery in the context of the international capitalist economy, this course places slavery at the center of America's economic development. Where earlier historians attribute this development to white immigrants and creative inventors in the North, we will explore the ways that slave trading entrepreneurs and their ever more brutal and cruelly efficient systems of slave labor were just as essential to the story of America's rise as an economic and imperial powerhouse. While northern factories depended on a pool of labor from Europe, Southern planters achieved a mobile supply of labor by ripping families apart. Southern enslavers engaged in technical innovations, economies of scale, and new methods of financing their operations. It was in the South, not in the North, for example, that a modern banking system emerged, underwritten by investments in the bodies of human beings. Students in this course will reexamine slavery to reconstruct the American economic development through studying quantitative, and statistical data. In addition to reading from the new economic histories of American slavery, the stories of capital, finance, cotton, labor, and technology will be illustrated through primary sources such as newspapers and slave narratives.",

The ability to think critically and compassionately and to make ethical and healthy choices is becoming more challenging every day, as we contend with the social, political, economic and environmental issues of our time. Through the exploration of their own, and others' identities, students in this course will begin to develop competencies with regards to diversity and equity - necessary skills to thrive in our world. Students will examine the cultural lenses through which they experience the world and are perceived by others, as well as learn about the historical, social and economic contexts of oppressed and underrepresented groups, augmenting their perspective and understanding of what it means to live in a diverse community, and world. The class will focus on a different aspect of identity each week, and explore these through the reading of texts and engagement with each other. Students will be asked to respond to readings in short reflection pieces, and they will write a final paper reflecting on their personal growth over the course of the term. The class may collect these reflections and create an anthology to be shared with the community. Students will also examine the appropriate and ethical use of online forums. This course will be a place where students can ask tough questions about their own and other's identity and think critically about issues of equity in our society. It will be a 10-week process that will hopefully lead students to want to continue conversations about diversity, equity and social justice on our campus, and take future classes about similar topics in college. If possible, we will attend a conference, such as the white privilege conference, that provides specific topics for high-school age attendees. Open to uppers and seniors.",

It draws from many disciplines, including physics, anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, kinesiology and computer science, as it explores the relationships among science, exercise and sports activities. Through in-depth study of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems and evaluations of those systems as they relate to exercise and activity, students will be able to safely assess, design, prescribe and update exercise programs. The goal of the course is to have students understand and produce a scientifically based training and fitness plan to help themselves and others more effectively prepare for the sport or activity of their choice. Lab-based, the course requires students to perform and measure simple activities, using several software packages in the Sports Science Lab, including Body Works, Ultra Coach and the N.E.A.T. video-computer interface. The text, The Manual of Structural Kinesiology, is supplemented with handouts from current journals such as the Journal of Science in Sport and Exercise and the Journal of Strength and Conditioning. Field trips to local exercise physiology labs are planned.",

In this course, students will spend the first half of the term exploring and discussing case studies of social innovation projects. These case studies, along with texts like Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and InsightOut: Get Ideas Out of Your Head and Into the World by Tina Seelig, will provide us with a working vocabulary for creative problem-solving methodologies and a historical understanding of successful endeavors from the past. The second half of the course will be devoted to student-designed group projects that tackle real-world problems. Groups will share their progress and elicit feedback from the full group through periodic presentations and reports. The class will operate at this stage as a laboratory for collaborative problem solving and will explore the range of strategies that can be used to tackle what social planners refer to as \"wicked problems.\" Some student groups may decide to enter their project in the University of New Hampshire's Social Venture Innovation Challenge at the end of the term.",

Some of the key ideas within the method are designing with a human-centered approach, using prototypes to facilitate design decisions, and embracing design refinements based on feedback. Students at Stanford, a leader in design thinking, used the method to design a low-cost infant warmer that reduces infant mortality in developing countries. Other students have created products featured on Kickstarter, such as a self-watering kitchen garden and a reinvented bicycle bell. At the start of the term, students in this class will learn about and apply each of the aspects of design thinking in a series of small projects in which they will work together to create solutions to real-world needs and problems. These projects will ask students to interview others to learn of their needs; to ideate with their peers to identify possible solutions; to build prototypes early and often; and to incorporate feedback to improve their design solutions. Tools and materials appropriate to making prototypes will be available. In the latter part of the term, students will choose their own larger-scale projects and spend the rest of the term developing them. They will have the class group for support and collaboration as they work through their projects individually or with a partner.",

We draw problems from the biological and physical sciences, political science, and sociology. Prerequisite: MAT41S. MAT43S builds on the principles of MAT41S and 42S, including more in-depth studies of probability theory.

While the origins of the subject involve the quest to solve cubic, quartic and quintic polynomial equations the resulting structures have proved useful in many other quarters. Groups, for instance, allow one to study symmetries of objects and to count them in an organized fashion. Matrices supply examples of non-commutative rings in which the distributive laws still work, finite Fields can be used to do arithmetic for coding problems and more. \nReal Analysis (Spring): We will study real numbers, functions and sets, and prove the theory behind calculus.

Anyone watching the news (or with a basic understanding of history) could reasonably argue that religious devotion can be all-consuming, violent or even harmful to self or others. Contemporary examples of the destructive side of religion fill the news on a daily basis. On the other hand, religions around the world have been a driving force for peace, for justice, for compassion, for leading a purposeful life.

We will consider how different modes of inquiry and experience can be distinguished from each other and then integrated in our understanding of knowledge.",

    "desc": "One of the most popular undergraduate courses at Stanford is entitled \"Designing Your Life\" - which implies that life, in fact, can be designed or planned out ahead of time. More often than not, however, life is not linear, but probably not totally random either. Utilizing the methods of \"design thinking\" this course will assist students in reflecting on how their lives might unfold, what choices they face in the future - in college and afterward - and how they might navigate those choices. What does it mean to come to \"know thyself ?\" Before one \"discovers one's passion\" - an overworked phrase - how does one determine one's interests? What is the difference between \"finding a job\" and \"discovering one's calling\" or vocation? What is \"meaningful work?\" What is a fulfilling life, and how does that affect one's personal and professional interests? Through a series of exercises and readings, the students will have the opportunity to follow a process of self-discernment, addressing the fundamental questions of \"Who am I?\" and \"Where am I going in life?\" The reading list will include selections from such books as Tina Seelig's InGenius and What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20; Parker Palmer's Let Your Life Speak: Listening for the Voice of Vocation; Burnett and Evans's Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life; William Deresiewicz's Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life; Mark Edmundson's Why Teach?: In Defense of a Real Education; Anthony Kronman's Education's End: Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life; Stuart Firestein's Failure: Why Science is So Successful; Matthew Syed's Black Box Thinking: Why Most People Never Learn from their Mistakes but Some Do; Bo Bronson's What Should I Do with My Life? and Plato's Alcibiades I. Group creativity exercises, drafting a failure r\u00e9sum\u00e9, sketching out several \"Odyssey Plans\" and writing personal reflection papers are part of the course.",

    "desc": "(Students paired with Exeter alumni working in the technology field) In a world where the products of technology permeate almost every aspect of our lives - the internet, smart phones, thousands of apps, cloud-based voice systems, screens in our classrooms, artificial intelligence, robotics, the gig economy, video gaming, virtual reality, and numerous other products and applications currently under development - what ethical challenges are raised by their ubiquity? This course focuses on a series of case studies in an industry where a well-known motto is \"move fast and break things,\" and where we will explore whether ethical considerations have kept pace with evolving technologies. Where does goodness fit in the knowledge revolution? If we have \"outsourced our brain to Google,\" as some would claim, have we also outsourced our ethics to them and other big tech companies as well? Technology's many benefits are clear in our lives, in part because it is natural to focus our attention on the new and novel, and in part because the industry touts those benefits. But have we consciously and adequately considered the drawbacks, or have we unwittingly paid for convenience with the erosion of fundamental values such as free speech, privacy, democratic values, personal reflection, and the nature and depth of relationships? In what ways have the traditional systems and modes of interaction in communications, the media, education, medicine, the traditional economy, even the basic operations of democracy itself, been challenged by these new technologies, and to what extent have we understood the ethical consequences of such challenges? Using specific case studies drawn from the vast and complicated world of technology, this course will assist the student in identifying the various ethical issues embedded in the world of technology and to develop strategies to deal with them. Readings will include many actual case studies plus articles and books, which are themselves case studies. An integral part of the course will have each student paired electronically with an Exeter alumnus/a working in a technology company who will help them identify and research an issue germane to the course, with students as a final project writing their own case study about ethics in technology.",

The primary focus of the class is on these discussions, specifically, gathering a group of energized and like-minded students who are interested in reading and talking about books and the issues contained therein. Drawing together the knowledge gleaned from their time at Exeter, and the various courses an Academy student might take, the students in this class will try to draw connections and synthesize the materials they have covered in other classes in their Exeter career as such information pertains to the various books this course might read. Although the reading list will change from year to year, depending upon the bestsellers of the day, in the recent past this course has and may read such books as Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers; Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In; Jon Krakauer's Missoula; Trevor Noah's Born a Crime;J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy; Roxane Gay's Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body; Ellen Pao's Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change; Bryan Stevenson's Just Mercy; Sherry Turkle's Reclaiming Conversation; Levitt and Dubner's Freakonomics; Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me or We Were Eight Years in Power; Amy Chua's Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom; Marina Keegan's The Opposite of Loneliness; Michael Lewis's The Undoing Project, plus many others in whole or in part.
