Where earlier historians attribute, this development to white immigrants and creative, inventors in the North, we will explore the ways, that  slave trading entrepreneurs and their ever, more brutal and cruelly efficient systems of slave, labor were just as essential to the story of, America's rise as an economic and imperial, powerhouse. While northern factories depended on a, pool of labor from Europe, Southern planters, achieved a mobile supply of labor by ripping, families apart.  Southern enslavers engaged in, technical innovations, economies of scale, and new, methods of financing their operations.  It was in, the South, not in the North, for example, that a, modern banking system emerged, underwritten by, investments in the bodies of human beings., Students in this course will reexamine slavery to, reconstruct the American economic development, through studying quantitative, and statistical, data.

The study of social, stratification asks how structure provides, opportunities or creates limits for the people, within it and how social inequalities are created, and perpetuated.  , In this course, students will look at the origin, emergence, reproduction, and consequences of, social stratification and social inequality in the, United States. The course will draw on, sociological theories and empirical studies to, examine historical and contemporary manifestations, of social stratification. Students will learn to, describe and discuss the intersections of social, identities and the roles that social institutions, play in shaping culture.",

This course will focus on the, ability of statistical thermodynamics to employ, simple physical models, along with some inspired, mathematics, to predict the behavior of atoms and, molecules (referred to as, \"the unreasonable, effectiveness of unrealistic simplifications\")., The concept of entropy will be a unifying theme, throughout the course, and, given its central, role, time will be devoted to developing a, rigorous mathematical model of entropy through the, use of probability and multi-variable calculus., The more traditional topics of thermodynamics will, be presented relatively quickly. The first and, second laws of thermodynamics will be explored;, the fundamental equations of thermodynamics, as, differential equations, will be used to define the, properties of temperature, pressure and chemical, potential; and the concept of free energy (and its, importance in describing equilibrium) will be, developed. The Boltzmann distribution law (and the, partition function) will be derived and then used, along with simple physical models, to compute, thermodynamic and physical properties of systems, at equilibrium.  Following a brief look at quantum, theory and statistical mechanics, the equilibrium, constant expression will be derived (by employing, the partition function) and values for gas-phase, chemical equilibrium constants will be computed, and compared to empirical values. Finally, lattice, models will be used to explore properties of, liquids, liquid/vapor equilibrium and solutions., There will be some experimental work, allowing, students the opportunity to study an actual system, and use the simple models, and mathematics, of, statistical thermodynamics to investigate its, physical and/or chemical behavior.",
