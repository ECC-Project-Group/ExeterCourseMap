    "desc": "Anthropologists study humans as both biological, and cultural creatures. This scholarly orientation, raises many fascinating questions. To what degree, does culture shape our actions and ideas? Are we, primarily products of biological nature or, cultural nurture? Can cultural norms make rational, people act irrationally? Are there universal human, rights or do cultures dictate what we think is, ethical? These debates are critical for, understanding human interaction and have, significant application in fields ranging from law, to medicine. Although discussions of these topics, many times turn toward scientific explanations, this course provides students an opportunity to, explore other scholarly orientations; namely, the, nurture side of the debate. Using various, anthropological approaches, students will explore, patterns of behavior, both consciously articulated, and unconsciously practiced, that enriches and, profoundly shapes our lives. Among the topics, considered are: \"the mind\" and epistemology;, discipline, law, and rules; human bodies and, communication; social taboos; ritual patterns of, meaning; notions of cleanliness and defilement;, festivals; and mythology. These elements of, cultural life will be explored in social settings, spanning the globe, but also within our own, community at Phillips Exeter Academy. To gain a, greater appreciation of these topics, students, will be exposed to classic readings in, anthropology, developing a sense of the field as, it emerged out of the late 19th-century. Much of, the course attempts to contextualize 20th-century, anthropological methods against the foil of, postmodern critiques.",

By working collectively on this publication, students will learn how to professionally document their artwork, craft an effective artist statement, and understand their work within the greater context of the art world. This course culminates in an exhibition of capstone projects in the Mayer Art Center. The accompanying publication serves as an exhibition-in-print and visual anthology of the class capstones. Prerequisite: ART500. Offered: spring term.   The primary goal of the Department of Classical Languages is to develop in our students the ability to read and appreciate significant works of Greek and Latin literature in the original language. The Greeks and the Romans asked fundamental questions about what it means to be human: What is goodness? What is knowledge? These are not questions that afford easy or definite answers, but people like Plato and Vergil got the ball rolling and their voices still speak to us two thousand years later. To hear these voices is to reflect on how they have been received, resisted, used and misused by many cultures that followed. More importantly, their intrinsic brilliance and originality make them worth studying for their own sake. Translations are but a pale shadow of the real thing, so by learning Greek and Latin, students gain direct access to the thoughts and feelings of the authors themselves. Many of their works are as daring now as they were millennia ago, which may surprise those who equate \u201cclassical\u201d with \u201cold- fashioned.\u201d Some will provoke dissent, but rather than place Greco-Roman culture on a pedestal, we want our students to engage critically with it, which in turn encourages them to question systems of value and meaning in their own culture. To implement this goal, we have written our own introductory Latin textbook titled Ludus and our own introductory Greek textbook titled \u0391\u0393\u03a9\u039d. Both follow the same set of principles: An abiding, concomitant goal is to make our students intellectually independent, both of their instructor and of auxiliary materials such as dictionaries. Our ideal is that students will acquire a truly active knowledge of Latin and Greek and so become their own best teachers and critics. Students take an active role in class from the earliest stage, whether explaining work they have displayed on the board or posing questions and suggestions to their peers. Students become able with increasing frequency to take the lead during classes, whether in assessing the accuracy of a translation or in leading the discussion of a passage of Vergil\u2019s Aeneid or of a Platonic dialogue. The capstone of our program is the Classical Diploma. To fully appreciate classical literature as a product of two interconnected cultures, students should know both Latin and Greek, and the wearing of laurel wreaths on commencement day symbolizes this achievement. Students may advance even further beyond the requirements of the Classical Diploma, knowing that our department is committed to offering classes in Latin and Greek to match the highest level they are able to attain. Although our department focuses on the study of classical languages, we also want to expose our students to the other disciplines that inform the field of Classics: namely, history and archaeology. We encourage interested students to enroll in Classical Greece (HIS203) and Roman History for Latin Students (HIS314) and to participate in the many opportunities to experience antiquity firsthand, such as the Spring Study Tour in Rome (offered in even years), the Winter Term in Rome (offered in odd years) and the Summer Archaeology Programs in France, Italy and Greece. Classical Diploma Latin Concentration The Classical Diploma with a Latin concentration is awarded to students who successfully complete both a Latin course and a Greek course from the following options: The last course in the sequence of courses in each language must be taught by an Academy teacher. Seniors who wish to earn the Classical Diploma but also to participate in the Washington Intern Program or another off-campus, spring-term program, may do so by successfully completing Latin 621 and Greek 421; students who wish to participate in off-campus programs in the fall or winter of their senior year should plan to start Greek before their senior year.

The fruit fly is used as a model system because it has insulin- producing cells and many of the regulatory pathways are the same as in humans. A critical part of this work, as in all experiments involving fruit flies, is to be able to control gene expression as specifically as possible. Students will be involved in finding regions of DNA that control gene expression in fruit flies. To do this they will learn current techniques in fly biology, florescence microscopy, molecular biology and bioinformatics. Useful strains of flies made and characterized by students will be used by researchers in Dr. Kim\u2019s lab and made available to all scientists working on fruit flies.

There are more than 16 million such compounds that occur both naturally and synthetically, and many more are discovered and synthesized each year. Organic chemistry is important in many fields such as medicine, pharmaceutical science and materials science, as well as in the production of fragrances, food products, automobiles and many other items. There are two main focal points of this course. First, after learning the names, structures, nomenclature and reactivity of the functional groups found in most organic molecules, students will be engaged in extensive laboratory investigations exploring these functional groups as they synthesize common organic materials. Such investigations include the synthesis of oil of wintergreen, aspirin, rubber, Plexiglass, polyurethane foam, nylon, soap and fragrant esters. The second area of focus is learning laboratory techniques particular to organic chemistry such as distillation, refluxing, and extraction. Prerequisite: One year of introductory chemistry.

This course will focus on the ability of statistical thermodynamics to employ simple physical models, along with some inspired mathematics, to predict the behavior of atoms and molecules (referred to as, \u201cthe unreasonable effectiveness of unrealistic simplifications\u201d). The concept of entropy will be a unifying theme throughout the course, and, given its central role, time will be devoted to developing a rigorous mathematical model of entropy through the use of probability and multi-variable calculus. The more traditional topics of thermodynamics will be presented relatively quickly. The first and second laws of thermodynamics will be explored; the fundamental equations of thermodynamics, as differential equations, will be used to define the properties of temperature, pressure and chemical potential; and the concept of free energy (and its importance in describing equilibrium) will be developed. The Boltzmann distribution law (and the partition function) will be derived and then used, along with simple physical models, to compute thermodynamic and physical properties of systems at equilibrium. Following a brief look at quantum theory and statistical mechanics, the equilibrium constant expression will be derived (by employing the partition function) and values for gas-phase chemical equilibrium constants will be computed and compared to empirical values. Finally, lattice models will be used to explore properties of liquids, liquid/vapor equilibrium and solutions. There will be some experimental work, allowing students the opportunity to study an actual system and use the simple models, and mathematics, of statistical thermodynamics to investigate its physical and/or chemical behavior.

Economics helps people understand how individuals and businesses make decisions and how the interplay of market forces and government interventions in the economy affects people\u2019s well-being. Economic thinking can be instrumental in approaching societal problems such as racial and gender discrimination, environmental degradation and inequality. Students of economics also gain insight into the causes of long-run changes in standards of living across populations and of short-run fluctuations in economic performance. The discipline emphasizes an understanding of the trade-offs we face when trying to choose how to use scarce resources while preserving long-run sustainability of production and achieving an equitable distribution of the economy\u2019s output.  Seniors who are interested in the study of economics at Exeter may choose from five offerings. With the exception of ECO520: Microeconomic Theory and Policy, these courses have no prerequisites. Students interested in the history of economic development in the Western world and in the philosophies of the well- known political economists such as Adam Smith and Karl Marx, and less historically recognized thinkers such as Eric Williams, should enroll in HIS506: Capitalism and Its Critics, offered in the fall term. Students who wish to understand why standards of living remain so low in dozens of countries across the world and how policies might help reduce poverty should take HIS556: Why Are Poor Nations Poor?, which is offered in the winter term. Students who desire a one-term introduction to both microeconomic and macroeconomic issues should take ECO502: Principles of Economics and Business, offered in the spring, which emphasizes an understanding of contemporary economic and business topics, especially issues of political controversy. This course is not open to students who take ECO510 or ECO520. It emphasizes an understanding of contemporary economic and business topics, especially issues of political controversy. Finally, students who prefer an in-depth exploration of economic theory and models and of their applications to contemporary problems should enroll in one or both of the following courses: ECO510: Macroeconomic Issues in the United States, which focuses on the behavior of the national economy (offered in the winter term), and ECO520: Microeconomic Theory and Policy, which covers the behavior of individual consumers, businesses and markets (offered in the spring term). These two courses work well as a sequence, and ECO510 is a prerequisite for ECO520. However, students may choose to take ECO510 without taking ECO520; with permission of the instructor, they may be allowed to take ECO520 without having taken ECO510. In most cases, however, students who don\u2019t take ECO510 in the winter and wish to take an economics class in the spring should take ECO502 instead of ECO520. Note: Economics courses do not give credit toward the History Department requirement. Economics 502 and 520 may NOT be taken in the same term.

Learning theory rooted in, anthropology and ethnomusicology will help, students form a shared vocabulary about how dance, intersects with society and how politics and power, have shaped a cultural dance expression. The work, of several notable dance anthropologists will be, read and discussed. Through embodied practice, students will learn a range of disciplines, both, contemporary and traditional or folk. These may, include but are not limited to: Ballet, Bellydance, Bharatanatyam, Breaking, Capoeira, Contemporary, Indonesian dance, Irish Step, Hip, Hop, Hula, Jazz, Musical Theater, Salsa, Samba, Swing, Tango, West African and dance of the, African diaspora and Voguing. This course will, make at least one off-campus trip to observing, dance \"in the field.\"  Students engage in, reflective writing and movement exercises and are, encouraged to share their own movement style and, cultures. Final projects will feature a choice, between an analytical paper, a creative media, project (like website, blog or short documentary, film) and a choreographed dance project.",

This course will examine those phenomena from both the human level and the bird\u2019s-eye view of the country and the world. We will examine the political implications of these decisions. Topics will include important micro and macroeconomic questions, such as: What is income inequality and how is it racialized and gendered? How does inequality affect the economy as a whole? What happens when we raise the minimum wage? Who are the winners and losers in international trade? When is the right time to raise or cut taxes? Where does innovation come from? What allows some to gain greater influence than others in the economy?

You will discuss the assumptions long held, and newly re-examined, within macroeconomics. You will also examine the necessary interface of the economy with the political system, which makes this problem- solving messier than the theory might imply.

What allows some to gain greater influence than others in these markets? And how can we harness the power of economic thinking at the ground level to influence our understanding of societal issues such as discrimination and environmental degradation? You will also consider what the limits might be of that economic thinking on social problems. We study supply and demand and the allocation of scarce resources; price controls (including the minimum wage); taxation and its effects on consumers and producers; income distribution; and environmental regulation.

Despite her quiet life in the English countryside of the early 19th century, Jane Austen captured this tension in a way that echoes through the ages, such that her works continue to be adapted for stage and film today (and even borrowed for new written works, such as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies). As we study Jane Austen\u2019s intricately calculated plots and consider how action releases meaning, we will also think about how people get it wrong or get it right with language, examining in particular the role of intellect and humor in both concealing and revealing the truth as we manage our emotional lives. Students will write short pieces analyzing and perhaps imitating Austen\u2019s style. Offered: winter term.  ",

Readings will include selections such as: The Compass of Pleasure by David Linden; Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi; and Forces of Habit by David Courtwright. Open to seniors. Offered: winter term.   History faculty members seek to challenge Exeter students to think critically and to write and speak clearly through the study of the historical experience of global communities. Knowledge of the past will allow students to understand the present, to consider their own beliefs and to develop empathy for those different from themselves. Such learning will enable students to lead lives that reflect the values of knowledge and goodness sought in Exeter\u2019s founding charter. To achieve these goals, the faculty share with one another their historical knowledge and teaching methods, and keep abreast of current historical and pedagogical thinking. In our work, we endeavor to enrich the intellectual life and cultural awareness of the Exeter community by encouraging reflection about history and contemporary issues. Course offerings in the department are open to the following students: 200-level courses are open to 9th graders and also to 10th graders who have not yet taken a history course at PEA; 300 level-courses are open to 10th graders and 11th graders, as well as 9th graders who have already taken a 200-level course; 400-level courses are open to 11th graders and seniors and to 10th graders who have taken a 300-level course; and 500-level courses are open to 11th graders who have taken a 400-level course as well as to seniors and PGs. Introductory courses, numbered in the 200s, emphasize fundamental skills in the study of history and the social sciences: gathering and interpreting evidence, analyzing concepts, and generalizing and synthesizing in frequent written exercises. Intermediate courses, numbered in the 300s, utilize more difficult materials, involve the study of more complex concepts and demand a higher level of competence than the 200-level courses. All introductory and intermediate courses include a library research project, typically culminating in an essay. Advanced courses are numbered in the 400s and 500s. The American history sequence \u2014 410, 420 and 430 \u2014 is a rigorous, year-long course and is required for the diploma. Each term of the U.S. history sequence includes a significant historical research project and time in the library dedicated to research. The fall term emphasizes how to begin a work of research and culminates in a paper, annotated bibliography or other work. In the winter term, students focus on the library\u2019s extensive availability of periodicals, which culminates in a five- to seven- page paper. The research paper in the spring term is expected to be 12 to 15 pages. The 500-level courses are often more topical in nature. Writing assignments and class meetings may be fewer in number than at other levels in order to accommodate more- sophisticated readings and independent work. Advanced Placement exams: The department does not confine itself to teaching in order to prepare students for standardized tests. We believe that such an approach would compromise our commitment to student-centered discussion, close reading of primary and secondary sources, and independent research and writing. Those students wishing to take AP exams in history are strongly advised to undertake sustained review on their own. Courses in anthropology and economics are taught under the aegis of the History Department. These courses, however, do not satisfy the history requirement. Three-year and four-year students are required to take at least one of the following courses: 200, 202, 205, 206, 207, 208, 305, 307, 308, 309, 502, 556, 558, 563, 565, 566, 567, 577, 586 and 587. These courses are marked by \u25c6 in the individual course descriptions.   This course is an introduction to significant events in the 20th century. Students investigate cause, effect and change in places such as Europe, Africa and Asia (including the Middle East). One principal aim of the course is for students to develop a better understanding of the response of traditional societies to the impact of modernization on their values and customs. Another is to examine ideological conflicts of the modern world. Students also research contemporary problems that originated in the 20th century that demand creative and thoughtful solutions. Analytical skills, synthesis of conflicting viewpoints, conducting research in the Academy Library, participating in debates and writing historical essays are all emphasized in this course. Open to 9th graders and 10th graders who have not taken a 300-level history course. Offered: fall term.  ",

It starts in roughly 1700 with a study of the Mughal Empire and its decline, followed by the rise of British India. We explore the East India Company and the impact of British imperialism on India. The 1857 rebellion, the beginning of direct British rule and the consequences of these major events are analyzed. We explore the development and role of the Indian National Congress, explore the emergence of Indian nationalism, and assess Gandhi and other Indian leaders, as well as the forces around independence in 1947.

Social scientists thus contend that racial distinctions are a product of society and culture rather than biology.

We will consider how humans have been divided into different \u201cgroups\u201d and the historical circumstances that have led to those divisions. Case studies will include: caste groups in India, religious groups in the Middle East and Europe, African slavery, and the treatment of indigenous groups by colonial settlers in Africa, Australia, India and the Americas.

Where earlier historians attribute, this development to white immigrants and creative, inventors in the North, we will explore the ways, that  slave trading entrepreneurs and their ever, more brutal and cruelly efficient systems of slave, labor were just as essential to the story of, America's rise as an economic and imperial, powerhouse. While northern factories depended on a, pool of labor from Europe, Southern planters, achieved a mobile supply of labor by ripping, families apart.  Southern enslavers engaged in, technical innovations, economies of scale, and new, methods of financing their operations.  It was in, the South, not in the North, for example, that a, modern banking system emerged, underwritten by, investments in the bodies of human beings., Students in this course will reexamine slavery to, reconstruct the American economic development, through studying quantitative, and statistical, data. In addition to reading from the new economic, histories of American slavery, the stories of, capital, finance, cotton, labor, and technology, will be illustrated through primary sources such, as newspapers and slave narratives.",

Language classes promote authentic engagement through immersion and participation. Language study is at its best in small classes where students actively communicate and collaborate. Students studying a new language at Exeter grow to understand and celebrate different cultural traditions.

Harkness discussion in a new language fosters flexibility, adaptability, discernment of nuance, and comfort with the ambiguities of languages and cultures in constant evolution. Students should choose the language that interests them most. Curiosity and creativity drive the study of language through the lens of intercultural experiences. All classes respect homework guidelines so that no language requires more work than another, and grades are consistent throughout the department. Students can meet the diploma requirement through Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian or Spanish. Those who wish to study a language begun at a previous school may take a placement test. Many students choose to begin a new language either upon arrival at the Academy or after completing the diploma requirement in another language. The accelerated two-term sequence in Italian and three-term sequence in Arabic are for seniors only. Exeter\u2019s varied options for term-abroad programs (China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and Spain) allow seniors to apply their classroom learning to real-life experiences, live with host families, hone their language skills via day-to-day immersion, and actively engage in the richness of intercultural literacy. Instructors rely on a variety of media \u2014 films, video clips, music, television programs, newspapers and magazines \u2014 to deepen linguistic and cultural competency at all levels. With an eye toward nurturing responsible global citizenship, the department emphasizes communication and culture through multiple avenues, including literature, history, art, philosophy, sports, films and current events. A wide selection of advanced courses provides students with a unique opportunity to pursue their passions and develop a high degree of competency in their language. Whether This sequence of courses is offered fall (ARA111), winter (ARA121) and spring (ARA131). This intensive three-term sequence introduces students to the phonology script and syntax of Modern Standard Arabic. Students will concentrate on developing the four skills of reading, speaking, listening and writing. Texts will be supplemented with cultural materials representative of the contemporary Arabic world and will include newspapers, magazines and videos. Open to seniors only. Students will be selected on the basis of proven linguistic abilities. Prerequisite: Permission of the department.   This sequence of courses is offered fall (CHI110), winter (CHI120) and spring (CHI130). These courses are designed to provide students with a new cultural lens through which to see both the Chinese world as well as themselves. In addition to traditional language-learning exercises, students achieve language and cultural proficiencies through games, role-play, songs, calligraphy and other interactive exercises. They also gain a new perspective on the concepts of respect and courtesy, both of which are deeply rooted in Chinese culture. They are able to greet people, talk about family, friends, home and school life, describe their hobbies and daily routines, and converse in shopping situations. Through the celebrations of traditional Chinese festivals such as the Mid- Autumn Festival and Chinese New Year, students can interact with the Chinese world via cooking and tasting authentic Chinese food, making arts and crafts, and watching snippets of linguistically relevant Chinese television programs. This intensive introduction to the language of China is a fascinating jump-start through the doorway to the Middle Kingdom and the language, culture and perspectives that have shaped its people. ",

The Science Department\u2019s primary mission is to provide for all students a foundation of excellence in the study of science. Whether as scientists or as scientifically literate citizens, Exonians must be well-prepared to enter a world of increasing social and technological complexity. In order to assist students in reaching this goal, the science curriculum is designed to offer students a variety of opportunities to engage with the world around them \u2014 in the classroom, in the laboratory and in field work. Hands-on learning, both collaborative and individual, is at the heart of our course of instruction. The department considers the laboratory and the field to be its Harkness table, and students will have extensive practical experience. Therefore, classrooms in the Phelps Science Center and in the Grainger Observatory include both laboratory and discussion space. The department has integrated technology into the curriculum in a variety of guises, all designed to place the tools for discovery directly into the hands of the students. The Science Department believes that successful scientific inquiry requires the integration of observational ability, quantitative skills and analytical thinking; in all courses, students will be challenged to reason creatively and to think critically. In keeping with the program broadly outlined above, the Phillips Exeter Academy Science Department strongly encourages students to take all three basic courses \u2014 biology, chemistry and physics \u2014 as a minimal preparation for college. LABORATORY POLICY FOR BIOLOGY  Laboratory work is an essential and integral part of the biology curriculum in the Science Department. The proximity to local ponds, rivers and the coast allows students to collect and observe physical and chemical principles critical to cell structure and function are also studied. Biology 220 completes the study of human anatomy and physiology. The remainder of the term is devoted to a study of genetics (classical and molecular), nucleic acids and evolution.

All reading material for this course will include aspects of these four themes, like the story \u201cEl lobo, el bosque y el hombre nuevo\u201d by Senel Paz and its film version, Fresa y chocolate, or Juan Rulfo\u2019s short story \u201cEs que somos muy pobres\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s that we are very poor\u201d). Prerequisite: any 500-level Spanish course. Offered: winter term.  Music engages our highest faculties of listening, reasoning, imagining and feeling. The study of music is a fundamental part of a well-rounded education. An essential way to explore our common humanity, music simultaneously cultivates self-discovery and empathy. An experience rich in musical challenge and reward teaches lessons that extend beyond the classroom, studio or concert hall. The department seeks both to instruct students in music and to enrich the life of the school through performance and community engagement, giving voice to a common spirit in times of occasion; a powerful expression of non sibi. For students of any level of experience or area of musical interest, there is an appropriate point of entry to the curriculum. Our program is realized through three areas of study: performing ensembles, private lessons and the academic classroom. In ensembles, students learn the art of collaborative music-making and listening. Students taking private lessons explore technique, interpretation and self-expression. In the classroom, students study the theoretical, historic and cultural contexts that awaken interest in, and understanding of, the musical language. The fullest educational experience combines study in all three areas to develop musically literate students who will be engaged in music throughout their lives.   This course is a workshop for students interested in making modern styles of music, primarily through technology. Students will develop their technique, their aesthetic and their ears by working on multiple collaborative and independent projects across a spectrum of musical genres including (but not limited to) pop, hip-hop, EDM, ambient and experimental. There will also be opportunities for live performances, cross-disciplinary collaboration and student- initiated projects. The in-class studio environment will be one of creativity, curiosity and collaboration as students work both together and alongside each other in pursuit of their musical goals. Provides 1/3 credit per term toward the studio/performance arts requirement; credit is granted upon completion of three consecutive terms of study. Also offered for no credit. Two evening sessions per week. No audition required. Students do not need to know how to read music.  ",
